  <h2>Chocolate Hills</h2>
  <p>
  Curious why it’s called the Chocolate Hills when it’s not really made of chocolates? It’s because these hills, which are usually covered in green grass, dry up and turn chocolatey brown in color during the dry season. There are more than a thousand hills spread over an area of 50 square kilometers in the towns of Carmen, Batuan, and Sagbayan in Bohol. And, while the hills do vary in size, looking at these from afar, it seems like they’re almost symmetrical in shape. This results in a majestic landscape that might make you think it’s a man-made creation.

  <h2>Rizal Park</h2>
  <p>
  Still widely known as 'Luneta' (its name until the 1950s), Manila’s iconic central park is spread out over some 60 hectares of open lawns, ornamental gardens, ponds, paved walks and wooded areas, dotted with monuments to a whole pantheon of Filipino heroes. As the place where José Rizal was executed by the Spanish colonial authorities, it's also of great historical significance. The Rizal Park Visitors Centre provides a map detailing some 40 sights within the park.
